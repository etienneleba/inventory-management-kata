# Inventory Management Kata: Integrating Local Commerce and a E-commerce

### Problem Statement

You are tasked with developing an inventory management system that bridges the gap between a local physical store and an online SquareUp store. The objective is to ensure consistent stock levels between both sales channels, providing a single source of truth for inventory management. The system must handle in-store purchases, online orders, and alert the store owner when stock levels are low.

The solution should be able to:

- **Synchronize Inventory**: Update stock levels in SquareUp (as the single source of truth) whenever sales occur.
- **Manage Both Sales Channels**: Ensure that sales from either channel (local or online) correctly update the shared inventory.
- **Notify for Low Stock**: Alert the store owner when stock for a product falls below a certain threshold.
